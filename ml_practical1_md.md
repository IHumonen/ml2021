Task 3  
Q) Which feature is best? Which feature is worst?  
A) The best feature is "systems" (with score 0.9), the worst feature is "easy" (with score 0,5)

Task 4  
Q)How does the performance compare to the single-feature classifiers?  
A)Tree with maximal depth has score 0.95 (not 1.0 because feature strings 4 and 17 are identical with each over at all columns except 'ok'). This score is better that any of single-feature classifiers' scores, but feature "systems" is still thery good.

Task 5  
Q)Plot performance against maxdepth
